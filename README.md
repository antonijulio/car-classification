## FACE CLASSIFIER [prototype]

It is a prototype application of implementing the `Naive Bayes` algorithm with `GLCM` feature extraction. Users can send images of group members' faces through the `Flutter` interface integrated with the frontend of the application. The image data is then received by a server running a Python script using `apiserver.py` as the main component in the data reception and processing process.
